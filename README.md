# AngryAliens
The game "Angry Aliens" is developed for CET372. Unity Engine is used to develop.
Features expected from the project:

- Create a game start page. It is enough to have a title and a start button here.

- In the game, the player has 10 shots, after each shot, the shot right is reduced by 1.

- 3 enemy should be created with "instantiate" function.

- Enemies move towards the player at a constant speed.

- The game is over if any enemy hits the tank or if shots are over before the tanks are destroyed. A gameover popup opens, there is a "Play Again" button on the panel.

- If the player hits any enemies, the burning animation appears.

- When the player hits the tank, the ball and enemy will disappear.
